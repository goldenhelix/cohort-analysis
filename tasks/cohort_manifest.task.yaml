name: Cohort Manifest Generator
description: |-
  Creates a manifest file listing all VCF.gz files from an input directory.

  This task generates a manifest file that lists all VCF.gz files in a specified
  directory. The manifest file is used to specify the input files for downstream
  tasks that require a list of VCF files.

  ## Important Note
  This task should not be run directly. Instead:
  1. Use the "Build Cohort Annotation Track" workflow
  2. Select your existing cohort parameter file
  3. Select the folder containing your new VCF files
  
  The workflow will automatically run this task as part of the cohort workflow.
